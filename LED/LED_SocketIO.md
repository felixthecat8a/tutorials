# Controlling an LED with SocketIO
<!-- Express & SocketIO -->
## Express & SocketIO
[***Express***](https://expressjs.com/) is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of defining routes, handling HTTP requests, managing middleware, and serving static files.

[***Socket.IO***](https://socket.io/) is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It allows for event-based communication, where the server can send data to connected clients and clients can also send data to the server.

This tutorial shows how to control an Arduino's LED in real-time from a browser using Socket.IO and Johnny-Five with Node.js.
